# Minesweeper using React and Javascript

## Let me give you a quick heads up on the rules of this game:
This project demonstrates how a once-popular game- "Minesweeper" could be developed using ReactJS, Redux, and JavaScipt concepts and problem-solving techniques.
This game is about revealing all cells, without clicking on the mine’s location cells.
*	Left click for revealing the cell.
*	Right Click to flag the cell (that you don't want to reveal, you are guessing, it might have mines).
*	You will win if non-mines reveal become zero.
*	You lose if you click on a mine. A timer keeps a check when you end the game.

## Installation
*	Install current or latest version of node from https://nodejs.org/en/ for Windows Installer.
*	Install git from https://git-scm.com/ for Windows Installer to add or edit changes concurrently.
*	Install the latest version of VSCode editor from https://code.visualstudio.com/download for Windows. [You may use any compatible editor of your choice. I have used this one here.]
*	Add React Developer Tool & Redux DevTools from Chrome Extension
*	Import npm package by referring to guidelines specified https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

## Running the tests
* Import npm package by referring to the guidelines specified from the following document:
https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
*	Type on the command prompt: npm install 
*	Then type on the command prompt: npm start
* If the above steps are successful, then you will be redirected to the local port that you specified in your code; here I have set it to 3000. http://localhost:3000/
* Try playing the game. 

## Note: [Below outputs may help in quickly evaluating the assessment- Video and Photos]
* Kindly have a look at the demo video “Demo-MineSweeper-Execution_and_Working” to know how to execute this project and to get an insight into the working of this game. 
* I have also shared output pictures in the document “Output Pictures” of different events on a separate document. The code has been commented for simplification.
